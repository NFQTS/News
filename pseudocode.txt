What is this supposed to do?

Automatically find and distribute relevant news to social media and potentially store it on the blockchain (proof of history)

Why do this?

We need to ensure people have access to relevant news that is relatively propaganda free. Otherwise, people are easily manipulated and misled.

Functionality:

1.) Aggregate news stories from various sources.
2.) Track headlines, sources, and authors to help us find/rank the reliability of sources and headlines.
3.) Run the numbers through neural networks that help us predict story relevance.
4.) Distribute stories that are deemed relevant (start small to avoid overwhelm, then scale to be everywhere, including the possibility of blockchain-powered news)
5.) Get feedback to improve quality/relevance.

NOTE: Should consider adding contextual tags to headline rankings to give the neural network more ways to detect similarities.
